# What do we still need ?

* __Reliability__ : null safe, static, compile-time checks
* __Maintainability__ : readable, concise, simple
* __Productivity__ : write well, understand well & fast

Programming Language is at core of : 
* Humans : they read & write it
* APIs & Frameworks : as it defines their capabilities
* Tools (IDE, Factory) : it allow them to be efficient

But introducing breaking changes to existing language is very difficult.Can we stay on current Java roots for coming decade ?
