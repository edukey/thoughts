# Online IDE

https://github.com/styfle/awesome-online-ide

Look on project based (multiple files) and multiple languages

not just a one file snippet as jdoodle, ideone, codechef, online-ide, ide.geeksforgeeks.org ; and no single lang like codesandbox.io, jsfiddle, stackblitz

## Simple

Simple free IDEs with multiple files, manage dependencies (external libs), builds, executes as CLI

They usually instanciate a container with file persistence and the needed sdk/runtime
